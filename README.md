# shiny_travel

A simple R shiny app that keeps track of travelling distances, time spent in places and reasons.

Run in R:
```
runGitHub("shiny_travel","StevenVB12")
```

Note: To make the source code run, you will need to add a google maps API. Since June 2018, this has to be linked to billing information :s.
